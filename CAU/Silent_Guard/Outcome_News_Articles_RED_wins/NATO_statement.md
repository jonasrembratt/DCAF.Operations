# NATO statement

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

“NATO condemns, in the strongest terms, the unwarranted seizure of the COSCO Panama, a vessel engaged in humanitarian aid under UN authorization. This act represents a clear violation of international law and an obstruction of vital relief efforts for the Georgian people. We call on the Russian Federation to immediately release the ship, its cargo, and its crew, and to respect the principles of international stability and peace.”
