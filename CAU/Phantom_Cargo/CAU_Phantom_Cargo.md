# Phantom Cargo

NATO intelligence monitors an Ilyushin Il-76 Candid cargo plane, designated RA-86527, transiting the NATO-enforced No-Fly Zone (NFZ) over Abkhazia. Filed as a civilian flight en route to Sochi International Airport, the plane's mission appears routine until Sochi Tower denies its landing clearance, citing an unexpected runway emergency. The plane's crew subsequently requests an emergency diversion to Sukhumi International Airport within Abkhazia, a restricted zone under NATO jurisdiction.

This sudden diversion raises NATO's suspicions, prompting the NATO ATC center, Sentinel, to instruct players to intercept the Il-76, confirm compliance, and redirect it to Kutaisi airbase for inspection. As players engage the Il-76, tensions escalate further with protests from Russian ATC, Rostov Control, and a direct intervention from Black Sea Command, accusing NATO of violating Russian sovereignty. As the players approach the coast Sentinel comes online again, to cancel Kutaisi as the divert airbase, instead sending them on to Tbilisi International.

Just as the Il-76 nears the Abkhazian border en route to Tbilisi, the militia activates a hidden SA-6 SAM site and fires, attempting to destroy the aircraft. This ambush is designed to eliminate evidence of the Il-76's illicit cargo while enabling Russian propaganda to frame NATO for the destruction of the plane. If the attack succeed, players are tasked with rapidly recon the crash site and identify the SAM location, gathering evidence to counter the false-flag operation.

Should the players manage to save the plane, and continue on to Tbilisi, the militia will make a final desperate attempts to clear Russia from a possible scandal, now activating an SA-15 as the Candid is about to enter their approach to runway 13. The mission’s success depends on the players’ ability to intercept, recon, and neutralize the evolving threat while navigating the escalating geopolitical tensions surrounding the NFZ.
