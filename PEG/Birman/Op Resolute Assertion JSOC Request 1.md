Your role is to provide aerial reconnaissance, overwatch, and CAS as required, ensuring the safety of both FENRIS units and the HVI during extraction. You will also monitor for any hostile activity that may threaten the convoy or compromise the mission.

## Special Operations Units

**FENRIS 5**: Responsible for executing the pickup of Goblin and leading the convoy. They will operate with speed and discretion, focusing on safely transporting the HVI.

**FENRIS 2**: Tasked with overwatch, perimeter security, and communications with air assets. They will coordinate air support as needed to protect FENRIS 5 and the HVI.

**FENRIS 6**: Standing by outside city, as reserve ort backup.

## Operational Phases

### Initial Contact and Pickup (Phase 1)

`CODENAME: PUMPKIN PATCH`

FENRIS 5 will be responsible for driving the marked vehicle to a predetermined safe house, where they will secure and extract Goblin. The vehicle will arrive at the safe house designated by the codeword “*Pumpkin Patch*.”

FENRIS 2 will be stationed nearby, providing overwatch and security. They will monitor for enemy movements and coordinate with air assets to mitigate threats.

FENRIS 6 will be stationed outside the city, available as backup and to assist as needed.

### Convoy Escort and Security (Phase 2)

`CODENAME: TRICK OR TREAT`

Once Goblin is secured in the marked vehicle, FENRIS 5 will lead the convoy out of the city, following a designated extraction route.

FENRIS 2 will continue providing overwatch and threat assessment. They will be the primary point of contact for air assets, calling for support if the convoy comes under attack or if enemy activity is detected.

### Final Extraction (Phase 3)

`CODENAME: GRAVEYARD SHIFT`

The convoy will proceed to an extraction point outside Bandar Abbas, where allied forces will secure Goblin for transport. Air assets will maintain cover until the HVI is safely aboard an extraction aircraft.
Be prepared to engage any pursuing insurgent forces or disrupt ambush attempts as the convoy exits the urban area.

## Contingency Plan

`CODENAME: SPECTRE DRIFT`

PLan has failed but operators are not aborting. Operators will have to re-plan and adjust to succeed. Air assets will likely be called upon for security or reconnaissance assistance.

## Mission Abort

`CODENAME: COFFIN`

Mission has failed. Air assets might be called upon to provide security for ground operators as they make their way back.

## Current Intelligence Picture

**HVI Background**: Goblin, known as Colonel Idris Karam, possesses critical information on enemy logistics and strategic operations. His safe extraction is imperative to disrupting insurgent capabilities.

**Enemy Disposition**: The AO is under insurgent control, with mobile anti-air defenses and fortified positions. Enemy forces are aware of possible defection attempts and will act aggressively to intercept or eliminate the HVI.

**Civilians and Infrastructure**: The area is densely populated, requiring adherence to strict ROE to minimize civilian casualties. High vigilance and precision are crucial.
